# Simple image to pdf creator

- The idea of this app comes from my own need.
- Every now and then, I need scan some documents page by page and then send them via Email.
- I don't have a free tool to help me generate the pages together to on single pdf.
- So this one is quite simple and basic, which meet my needs.
- Hope it can help you to make your life easier too ;) 



## How to run
- download the files, run the "pdfCreator.html";
- choose you images from the files, and then click the "generate" pdf btn.
